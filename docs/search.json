    "text": "Academic Integrity Policy\nI fully support CUNY’s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, in part:\n\nAcademic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York. Penalties for academic dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion.\n\n\nAcademic integrity is at the core of a college or university education. Faculty assign essays, exams, quizzes, projects, and so on both to extend the learning done in the classroom and as a means of assessing that learning. When students violate the academic integrity policy (i.e., “cheat”), they are committing an act of theft that can cause real harm to themselves and others including, but not limited to, their classmates, their faculty, and the caregivers who may be funding their education. Academic dishonesty confers an unfair advantage over others, which undermines educational equity and fairness. Students who cheat place their college’s accreditation and their own future prospects in jeopardy.\n\nIn this course, expectations for academic integrity are straightforward: no use of unauthorized materials on weekly quizzes, mid-semester tests, or the course final exam. Unless explicitly stated otherwise by the instructor in writing, the only authorized materials are the instructor-provided formula sheets.\nAcademic sanctions in this class will range from an F on the Assignment to an F in this Course. A report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students.\nStudents are encouraged to contact the instructor with any questions or concerns related to matters of academic integrity."

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.\nAll of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.\n\nMental Health Resources\nIf you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support.\nThe Baruch Counselling Center is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor or call them at 646-312-2155 during normal business hours; you can make an appointment online here. For more immediate support, please call NYC WELL (1-888-NYC-WELL or 1-888-692-9355).3\nAsking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend, family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to support that can help.\nIf you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the Baruch Campus Intervention Team.\n\n\nPhysical Health\nHealthy CUNY promotes well-being and a culture of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students. They can connect you with a variety of campus- and community-based healthcare providers.\nBaruch Health Services provides students with a full range of clinical health services. Call 646-312-2040 or email StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu to make an appointment.\n\n\nFood Security\nAll CUNY students have access to CUNY Food Pantries located throughout the five boroughs, thanks to the CUNY CARES program. CUNY CARES is also able to help qualifying students with SNAP (“Food Stamps”) enrollment.\n\n\nImmigration Status\nCUNY Citizenship Now! provides confidential, high-quality immigration law services to all CUNY students.\nNote that Citizenship Now!’s primary Manhattan office is located in the Heights, not on the Baruch campus and that an appointment is strongly recommended.

At the start of the following lecture, a short (15 minute) quiz drawn closely from the practice problems will be administered. The quiz questions will not be verbatim from the practice problems, but if you can answer the practice problems quickly and fluently, the quiz should pose little difficulty.\nThese in-class weekly quizzes will generate extra credit applied to your final aggregate score. Each quiz will receive a score out of 3 added directly to your final score. Because the final aggregate score is out of 400, perfect scores on all 12 weekly quizzes can raise your final aggregate score (pre-curve) up to 9%.\nTo take part in the weekly quizzes, please come to class with both i) a black or blue pen; and ii) a red pen (for peer grading) each week.\nMake-up opportunities for the weekly quizzes will only be allowed in exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances.\n\n\nRegrading Policy\nIf you feel an assignment has been improperly graded, please contact the instructor by private message on the course discussion board within 48 hours of the graded assignment being returned.

    "text": "Pre- and Post-Reading Suggestions\nStudents learn material most effectively when exposed to it on multiple occasions, ideally using alternative presentations strategies and formats.2 To this end, suggested pre-reading and post-reading is provided for each week of the course. Students are encouraged to pre-read the recommended text, which typically presents that week’s material in a less technical / more intuitive manner, before each week’s course session. Similarly, students are encouraged to review the post-reading for each week after lecture to see additional examples of topics covered.\nWhile lectures will focus primarily on ‘big picture’ and ‘major themes’, the recommended reading, especially the post-reading from BH, provides additional coverage of relevant technical detail.\nStudents with prior exposure to topics in probability may choose to omit pre-reading. In general, GS pre-reading introduces fundamentals of probability while DFO pre-reading reviews relevant mathematical tools. Students may also elect to consume post-reading as part of completing that week’s practice problems, rather than as a separate activity.\nStudents are responsible for all material appearing in the pre-reading, in lecture, and in the post-reading, but students will not be evaluated on reading per se."
