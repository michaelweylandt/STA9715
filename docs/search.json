Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.\nAll of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.\n\nMental Health Resources\nIf you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support.\nThe Baruch Counselling Center is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor or call them at 646-312-2155 during normal business hours; you can make an appointment online here. For more immediate support, please call NYC WELL (1-888-NYC-WELL or 1-888-692-9355).3\nAsking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend, family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to support that can help.\nIf you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the Baruch Campus Intervention Team.\n\n\nPhysical Health\nHealthy CUNY promotes well-being and a culture of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students. They can connect you with a variety of campus- and community-based healthcare providers.\nBaruch Health Services provides students with a full range of clinical health services. Call 646-312-2040 or email StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu to make an appointment.\n\n\nFood Security\nAll CUNY students have access to CUNY Food Pantries located throughout the five boroughs, thanks to the CUNY CARES program. CUNY CARES is also able to help qualifying students with SNAP (“Food Stamps”) enrollment.\n\n\nImmigration Status\nCUNY Citizenship Now! provides confidential, high-quality immigration law services to all CUNY students.\nNote that Citizenship Now!’s primary Manhattan office is located in the Heights, not on the Baruch campus and that an appointment is strongly recommended. Call 646-664-9350 during business hours for more information."

At the start of the following lecture, a short (15 minute) quiz drawn closely from the practice problems will be administered. The quiz questions will not be verbatim from the practice problems, but if you can answer the practice problems quickly and fluently, the quiz should pose little difficulty.\nThese in-class weekly quizzes will generate extra credit applied to your final aggregate score. Each quiz will receive a score out of 3 added directly to your final score. Because the final aggregate score is out of 400, perfect scores on all 12 weekly quizzes can raise your final aggregate score (pre-curve) up to 9%.\nMake-up opportunities for the weekly quizzes will only be allowed in exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances."
