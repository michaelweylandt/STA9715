## Course Accomodations

#### Disability Services

It is [CUNY policy](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/reasonable-accommodations-and-academic-adjustments/v-accommodations/) to provide Accommodations and Academic Adjustments to students with disabilities. 

Any student who has a disability who may need accommodations in this class should register as early as possible with [Student Disability Services](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/student-disability-services/) (SDS). Your registration with Student Disability Services is confidential, and is not recorded on your Baruch Academic Record. SDS can be reached by email at [disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu](mailto:disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu), by phone at [646-312-4590](tel:646-312-4590), or in person at NVC 2-272.

Please note that the instructor cannot provide accommodations unless requested by SDS.

#### Religious Accomodations

It is [CUNY policy](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/reasonable-accommodations-and-academic-adjustments/vi-religious-accommodations/) to provide accommodations for students' sincerely held religious beliefs. If a religious accommodation is requested, please contact the instructor at least two weeks in advance.

## Personal Resources[^2]

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. 

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. 

#### Mental Health Resources

If you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support.

The [Baruch Counselling Center](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/counseling/) is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor  or call them at [646-312-2155](tel:646-312-2155) during normal business hours; you can make an appointment online [here](https://baruch.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a4NCaYrV2Sk1cyg). For more immediate support, please call NYC WELL ([1-888-NYC-WELL](tel:646-312-2155) or [1-888-692-9355](tel:646-312-2155)).[^3] 

Asking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend, family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to support that can help. 

If you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the [Baruch Campus Intervention Team](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/campus-intervention-team/).

#### Physical Health

[Healthy CUNY](https://www.healthycuny.org/) promotes well-being and a culture of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students. They can connect you with a variety of [campus-](https://www.healthycuny.org/cuny-health-centers) and [community](https://www.healthycuny.org/community-health-resources)-based healthcare providers. 

[Baruch Health Services](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/health/) provides students with a full range of clinical health services. Call [646-312-2040](tel:646-312-2040) or email [StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu](mailto:StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu) to make an appointment.

#### Food Security

All CUNY students have access to [CUNY Food Pantries](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/transformation/cuny-cares/food-pantry/) located throughout the five boroughs, thanks to the [CUNY CARES](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/transformation/cuny-cares/) program. CUNY CARES is also able to help qualifying students with [SNAP ("Food Stamps") enrollment](https://www.cuny.edu/current-students/student-affairs/student-services/snap/).

#### Immigration Status

[CUNY Citizenship Now!](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/communications-marketing/citizenship-now/) provides confidential, high-quality immigration law services to all CUNY students.
